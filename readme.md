# BrainStream 🧠

BrainStream is a simple but powerful project that combines **Generative AI** and **LangChain** to make YouTube learning more interactive and efficient. Instead of watching entire videos or endlessly scrubbing for answers, you can simply **chat with the video** and get exactly the insights you need.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **Search YouTube Videos** directly from the app using Python.
- 🎥 **Select Any Video** and fetch its transcript automatically.
- 🌐 **Multi-language Transcript Support** — not just limited to English.
- ⚡ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** powered processing for accurate answers.
- 💬 **Ask Questions About the Video** and get AI-powered, clear responses.

## 🚀 Why BrainStream?

We often waste time watching long tutorials, lectures, or talks just to find one piece of information. BrainStream solves this by letting you:

- Interact with the knowledge inside videos
- Jump straight to the insights you need
- Save time and make learning more effective

This is my **first project in Generative AI and LangChain**, and it’s just the start of building more useful AI-powered tools.
